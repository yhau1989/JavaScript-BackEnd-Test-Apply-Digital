# Workflow Description
# This workflow does the following:
# 1. Sets up Node.js and installs the necessary dependencies.
# 2. Runs linters to check the code quality.
# 3. Runs unit tests.
# 4. If linters or tests fail, the workflow stops and does not allow the commit or pull request.
# 5. Writes in console the test results and coverage reports.
# 6. Notifies the team if there are failures in linters or tests.
